        - Optional
        - Type: string
    - */software/components/cron/structure_cron/frequency*
        - Description: Execution frequency for the command, using standard cron syntax. Minutes field can be 'AUTO :' in which case, a random value between 0 and 59 inclusive is generated. This can be used to avoid too many machines executing the same cron at the same time. See also the C<timing> element.
        - Optional
        - Type: string
    - */software/components/cron/structure_cron/timing*
        - Description: If the 'timing' dict is used to specify the time, it can contain any of the keys: 'minute', 'hour', 'day', 'month' and 'weekday'. An unspecified key will have a value of '*'. A further key of 'smear' can be used to specify (in minutes) a maximum interval for smearing the start time, which can be as much as a day. When a smeared job is created, a random increment between zero and the smear time is applied to the start time of the job. If the start time results in the job running on the following day, then all other fields (day, weekday, etc) will be suitably modified. When smearing is specified, then the start minute (and possibly hour, if smear is more than one hour) must be specified as a simple absolute (e.g. '2') and cannot be variations such as lists or ranges. Time specifications such as ranges, lists and steps are supported except for named values (e.g. "1" must be used instead of "mon").
        - Optional
        - Type: structure_cron_timing
    - */software/components/cron/structure_cron/command*

        - Optional
        - Type: string
    - */software/components/cron/structure_cron/log*

Functions
---------

 - structure_cron_log_valid
    - Description: Function to check that other log properties are not present when disabled is true
 - valid_cron_timing
    - Description: Validate contents of cron timing fields (see CRONTAB(5) for details) Cron timing fields can contain complex expressions (e.g. "1,5,13-23/2"). Rather than validate these in depth the aim here is to catch things that are obviously wrong, such as: * characters which are not valid in cron fields * out of range numbers (e.g. "35" in the hour field) * names in the wrong field (e.g. "tue" in the day of month field)
 - valid_cron_minute
    - Description: Convenience wrapper for validating cron minute field
 - valid_cron_hour
    - Description: Convenience wrapper for validating cron hour field
 - valid_cron_day_of_month
    - Description: Convenience wrapper for validating cron day of month field
 - valid_cron_month
    - Description: Convenience wrapper for validating cron month field
 - valid_cron_day_of_week
    - Description: Convenience wrapper for validating cron day of week field
 - valid_cron_frequency
    - Description: Validate contents of cron frequency field
