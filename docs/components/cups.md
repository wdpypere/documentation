### NAME

cups : CUPS configuration component

### DESCRIPTION

NCM component allowing to configure CUPS service and declare printers.

### RESOURCES

- `/software/components/cups/defaultprinter` : string (optional)

    Define the printer specified as the default printer. Printer must be listed in the printers list to be defined as
    the default printer.

- `/software/components/cups/nodetype` : string (optional)

    Possible values are `client` and `server`. `server` must be specified to start cupsd daemon.
    When `client` is specified and cupsd is running, it is stopped.

    Default : `server` on machine defined in `options/ServerName` or if this option is not defined (server assumed
    to be localhost), `client` on other machines.

- `/software/components/cups/options/...` : nlist (optional)

    This ressource is a list of properties corresponding to option keywords supported by CUPS configuration
    files (`cupsd.conf` and `client.conf`). See the configuration files provided by CUPS for the documentation about
    each possible option. It is a nlist where the key is the option name and the value the option value.

    An empty value is interpreted as "undefine the option". If present, the matching configuration line is
    commented out. To define an option with an empty value, you need to specify a value made of spaces.

    Generally, options apply either to server configuration or to client configuration. There is
    one exception, `ServerName`, which applies to both.

    **Note** : not all the CUPS options are currently implemented. If you get a message `unsupported option` when
    running this component, look at the comments at the beginning of component Perl source about how to add
    support for a new option.

- `/software/components/cups/options/ServerAlias` : list of string

    This option sets the `ServerAlias` option in cupsd configuration. It is interpreted as a list of string.

    Default : None

    Scope : server

- `/software/components/cups/options/ServerName` : string

    This option is a special case. It is used by both client and server. In the server configuration, if not defined
    or defined as local host, it is converted to the local host name. In client configuration file, if `ServerName`
    points to the current host, it is converted to "127.0.0.1" (CUPS default).

    Default : localhost (CUPS default)

    Scope : client and server

- `/software/components/cups/printers/...` : nlist (optional)

    List of printers to configure if the current node is the server node. This resource is a nlist where the key is
    the printer name. In addition to standard CUPS printer options (look at lpadmin
    documentation), the following printer properties are defined :

    - `delete` : boolean

        Allow to delete a printer previously defined. Deleting a non existent printer is not considered an error.

        If a node configuration contains both definition and deletion for the same printer, the printer is deleted.
        This allows for a common configuration with some printers defined and a node specific configuration where
        some printers are not defined.

        If delete is true, all other options are ignored.

        Default : no

    - `enable` : boolean

        If this property is false, allow to disable a printer (without deleting it).

        If a node configuration both enable and disable printer, the printer is enabled. This allows for a common
        configuration where printers are created disabled and enable on a per node basis.

        Default : yes

    - `printer` : string

        Define the printer/queue name on the server associated with this printer. For LPD, need to match a printcap entry.

        Used to build the printer URI.

    - `protocol` : string

        Define the protocol part of the printer URI (CUPS backend).

        Used to build the printer URI.

    - `server` : string

        Define the server part of the printer URI.

        Used to build the printer URI.
