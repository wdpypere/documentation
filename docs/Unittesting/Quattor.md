### SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Quattor qw(test_profile1 test_profile2...);

### DESCRIPTION

`Test::Quattor`

Module preparing the environment for testing Quattor code.

### LOADING

When loading this module it will compile any profiles given as arguments. So,

    use Test::Quattor qw(foo);

will trigger a compilation of `src/test/resources/foo.pan` and the
creation of a binary cache for it. The compiled profile will be stored
as `target/test/profiles/foo.json`, while the cache will be stored in
under `target/test/profiles/foo/`.

This binary cache may be converted in an
`EDG::WP4::CCM::CacheManager::Configuration` object using the
`get_config_for_profile` function.

### INTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE

#### Module variables

This module provides backup methods for several `CAF` modules. They
will prevent tests from actually modifying the state of the system,
while allowing an NCM component to follow a realistic execution path.

These backups record what files are being written, what commands are
being run, and allow for inspection by a test.

This is done with several functions, see **Redefined functions** below,
that control the following variables:

- QUATTOR\_TEST\_LOG\_DEBUGLEVEL

    If the environment variable QUATTOR\_TEST\_LOG\_DEBUGLEVEL is set, the unittests
    will run with this debuglevel (0-5). Otherwise the default loglevel is 'verbose'.

    To actually see the verbose or debug output, you need to run prove with verbose flag
    (e.g. by passing `-Dprove.args=-v` or by setting `-v` in the `<~/.proverc`>).

- `$log_cmd`

    A boolean to enable logging of each command that is run via CAF::Process.
    Can also be set via the QUATTOR\_TEST\_LOG\_CMD environment variable.

- `$log_cmd_missing`

    A boolean to log each cmd that has output mocked but has no output set.
    Can also be set via the QUATTOR\_TEST\_LOG\_CMD\_MISSING environment variable.

- `%files_contents`

    Contents of a file after it is closed. The keys of this hash are the
    absolute paths to the files.

    This hash is a global variable whose contents can be checked in a
    test, if necessary. But if you want to set the file content
    before using the [Path](../CAF/Path.md) methods (for example, using
    `set_file_contents`), it is preferable to use `%desired_file_contents`.

- `%commands_run`

    CAF::Process objects being associated to a command execution.

- `%commands_status`

    Desired exit status for a command. If the command is not present here,
    it is assumed to succeed.

- `%desired_outputs`

    When we know the component will call `CAF::Process::output` and
    friends, we prepare here an output that the component will have to
    deal with.

- `%desired_err`

    When the component may analyse the standard error of a component, we
    supply it through this hash.

- `%desired_file_contents`

    Initial contents for a file that should be "edited". The content of this hash
    (keys are the absolute path names) is managed/updated by all the `CAF::FileWriter`
    methods. It is preferable to use it rather than `%files_contents`, if you don't need
    to access its contents directly from another module (`CAF::FileWriter` methods give
    access to its contents in fact).

- `@command_history`

    CAF::Process commands that were run.

- `caf_path`

    A hashref with [Path](../CAF/Path.md) methods and arrayref of reference of used arguments

- `NoAction`

    Set `Test::Quattor::NoAction` to override `CAF::Object::NoAction`
    in any of the mocked `Test::Quattor` methods (where relevant, e.g.
    mocked FileWriter and FileEditor).

    E.g. if you want to run tests with `CAF::Object::NoAction` not set
    (to test the behaviour of regular `CAF::Object::NoAction`).

    Default is 1.

- `%immutable`

    The content of this hash (keys are the absolute path names) indicates
    if paths (files, directories, ...) are immutable (or not).
    Any modification to an immutable path will result in an error.

    You can add paths using the `set_immutable` function.

- `%status`

    The content of this hash (keys are the absolute path names) indicates
    current `CAF::Path::status` (`mode`, `mtime`, `owner` and/or `group`).

    You can add paths using the `set_status` function.

#### Redefined functions

In order to achieve this, the following functions are redefined
automatically:

- `CAF::Process::{run,execute,output,trun,toutput}`

    Prevent any command from being executed.

- `CAF::FileWriter::open`

    Overriding this function allows us to inspect its contents after the
    unit under tests has released it.

- `CAF::FileWriter::close`

    Overriding this function to force noaction and update
    mocked `%desired_file_contents`.

- `CAF::FileWriter::_close`

    Mock-only method to make the FileWriter instance not opened
    (in [IO::String](https://metacpan.org/pod/IO::String) sense).

    Required for cleanup of filehandles left by eg immutable paths.

- `CAF::FileWriter::_read_contents`

    Used to get the original content (for `<CAF::FileWriter-`close>>) and/or source
    (for `<CAF::FileEditor-`new>>) from the `%desired_file_contents`.

- `CAF::FileEditor::_is_valid_file`

    Mock using `is_file` function.

- `CAF::FileEditor::_is_reference_newer`

    Mock using `is_file` function (but no support for pipes or
    age test).

- `CAF::FileReader::_is_valid_file`

    Mock using `is_file` function (but no support for pipes).

- `CAF::Reporter::debug`

    Checks that each debug() call starts with a debuglevel between 0 and 5.

- `CAF::Reporter::debug`

    Checks that each debug() call starts with a debuglevel between 0 and 5.

- `IO::String::close`

    Prevents the buffers from being released when explicitly closing a file.

- `CAF::Path::file_exists`

    Return the mocked `is_file`

- `CAF::Path::directory_exists`

    Return the mocked `is_directory`

- `CAF::Path::any_exists`

    Return the mocked `is_any`

- is\_symlink

    Test if given [path](../components/path.md) is a mocked symlink

- has\_hardlinks

    Test if given [path](../components/path.md) is a mocked hardlink

    Note that it is not a perfect replacement for the c<CAF::Path> `has_hardlinks` because
    the current implementation of mocked hardlinks does not allow to mimic multiple references
    to an inode. The differences are : the link used at creation time must be queried, not the
    target (where in a real hardlink target and link are undistinguishable); if the path is
    a hardlink the number of references for the inode is always 1.

- is\_hardlink

    Test if `path1` and `path2` are hardlinked

- \_make\_link

    Add a mocked `_make_link`.

    This mocked method implements most of the checks done in `LC::Check::link`, the function
    doing the real work in `_make_link`, and returns the same values as [Path](../CAF/Path.md) `_make_link`.
    See [Path](../CAF/Path.md) comments for details.

    Internally, this mocked symlink/hardlink support uses the file contents to track that a path
    is a symlink or hardlink. Thus, in addition to the symlink() and hardlink() methods, a link
    can be created with `set_file_contents($filename, $Test::Quattor::SYMLINK)` for a symlink
    and `set_file_contents($filename, $Test::Quattor::HARDLINK)` for a hardlink.

- `CAF::Path::directory`

    Return directory name unless mocked `make_directory` or mocked `LC_Check` fail.

    (The `temp` is ignored wrt creating the directory name).

- `CAF::Path::LC_Check`

    Store args in `caf_path` using `add_caf_path`.

- `CAF::Path::cleanup`

    `remove_any` and store args in `caf_path` using `add_caf_path`.

- `CAF::Path::move`

    `remove_any` and store args in `caf_path` using `add_caf_path`.

- `CAF::Path::status`

    Set and compare status.

- `CAF::Path::_listdir`

    Mock underlying \_listdir method that does the actual opendir/readdir/closedir.

    Has 2 args, one directory and one test function. The is no validation
    of any kind. Do not use this method directly, use `listdir` instead.

### FUNCTIONS FOR EXTERNAL USE

The following functions are exported by default:

- `get_file`

    Returns the object that has manipulated `$filename`

- `set_file_contents`

    For file `$filename`, sets the initial `$contents` the component should see.
    It also sets the default [FileWriter](../CAF/FileWriter.md) permissions (`mode` 644).

    Returns the contents on success, undef otherwise.

- `get_file_contents`

    For file `$filename`, returns the contents on success, undef otherwise.

- `get_command`

    Returns all the information recorded about the execution of `$cmd`,
    if it has been executed. This is a hash reference in which the
    `object` element is the [Process](../CAF/Process.md) object itself, and the
    `method` element is the function that executed the command.

- `set_command_status`

    Sets the "exit status" we'll report for a given command.

- `set_desired_output`

    Sets the standard output we'll return when the caller issues `output`
    on this command

- `set_desired_err`

    Sets the standard error we'll receive when the caller issues
    `execute` on this command.

- `command_history_reset`

    Reset the command history to empty list.

- `command_history_ok`

    Given an arrayref of `required_commands`,
    it checks the `@command_history` if all commands were
    called in the given order (it allows for other commands to exist inbetween).
    The commands are interpreted as regular expressions.

    E.g. if `@command_history` is (x1, x2, x3) then
    `command_history_ok([x1,X3])` returns 1
    (Both x1 and x3 were called and in that order,
    the fact that x2 was also called but not checked is allowed.).
    `command_history_ok([x3,x2])` returns 0 (wrong order),
    `command_history_ok([x1,x4])` returns 0 (no x4 command).

    A second arrayref of `forbidden_commands` can be given,
    and the `@command_history` is then first checked that
    none of those commands occured.
    If you only want to check the non-occurence of commands,
    pass an undef as the first argument
    (and not an empty arrayref).

- `set_service_variant`

    Sets the [Service](../CAF/Service.md) variant to the one given in the command line:

    - `linux_sysv`

        Linux SysV, e.g, `/sbin/service foo start`

    - `linux_systemd`

        Linux, Systemd variant.

    - `solaris`

        Solaris and SMF variant.

    `Test::Quattor` defaults to `linux_sysv`.

- `force_service_variant`

    Force the variant by bypassing [Service](../CAF/Service.md) `AUTOLOAD` magic
    and defining the methods
    via glob assignments in the namespace.

    The first argument is the `$variant` to use.

    When testing subclassed [Service](../CAF/Service.md),
    the second (optional) argument is the subclass, followed by
    all other arguments as additional non-standard actions.

- set\_immutable

    Make [path](../components/path.md) immutable. Pass a false `bool` to make the path mutable again
    (not &lt;undef>, default is to make the path immutable).

- set\_status

    (Re)set status of [path](../components/path.md) to the options (`mode`, `mtime`, `owner` and/or `group`).

- is\_mutable

    Check if the path and parent path are mutable.
    (Parent path is not checked when `skip_parent` argument is true).

    Report an error prefixed with `prefix` and return 0
    when path (and/or parent path) is immutable.

- sane\_path

    sanitize path by

    - squash multiple '/' into one
    - remove all trailing '/'

- is\_file

    Test if given `$path` is a mocked file

- is\_directory

    Test if given `$path` is a mocked directory

- is\_any
Test if given [path](../components/path.md) is known (as file or directory or anything else)
- make\_directory

    Add a directory to the mocked directories.
    If `rec` is true or undef, also add all underlying directories.

    If `mutable` is true, always create the directory.

    If directory already exists and is a directory, return SUCCESS (undef otherwise).

- remove\_any

    Recursive removal of a [path](../components/path.md) from the files\_contents / desired\_file\_contents

- move

    move `src` to `dest`. If `backup` is defined and not empty string,
    move `dest` to backup (`backup` is a suffix).

- add\_caf\_path

    Add array of arguments to `caf_path` hashref using `name`

- reset\_caf\_path

    Reset `caf_path` ref. If `name` is defined, only reset that cache.

- dump\_contents

    Debug function to show the entries in `desired_file_contents`
    and `files_contents`.

    Options

    - log

        Pass a reporter/logger instance, and report with verbose level.
        By default, `Test::More::diag` is used.

    - filter

        Regex pattern to filter filenames to show (matches are kept).

    - prefix

        A message prefix

### BUGS

Probably many. It does quite a lot of internal black magic to make
your executions safe. Please ensure your component doesn't try to
outsmart the `CAF` library and everything should be fine.
