 - **opennebula_vmtemplate_pci**
    - Description: It is possible to discover PCI devices in the hosts and assign them to Virtual Machines for the KVM host. I/O MMU and SR-IOV must be supported and enabled by the host OS and BIOS. More than one PCI option can be added to attach more than one PCI device to the VM. The device can be also specified without all the type values. PCI values must be hexadecimal (0xhex) If the PCI values are not found in any host the VM is queued waiting for the required resouces. "onehost show <host>" command gives us the list of PCI devices and "vendor", "device" and "class" values within PCI DEVICES section as example: VM ADDR TYPE NAME 06:00.1 15b3:1002:0c06 MT25400 Family [ConnectX-2 Virtual Function] VM: The VM ID using that specific device. Empty if no VMs are using that device. ADDR: PCI Address. TYPE: Values describing the device. These are VENDOR:DEVICE:CLASS. These values are used when selecting a PCI device do to passthrough. NAME: Name of the PCI device. In this case to request this IB device we should set: vendor: 0x15b3 device: 0x1002 class: 0x0c06 For more info: http://docs.opennebula.org/5.0/deployment/open_cloud_host_setup/pci_passthrough.html

    - *opennebula_vmtemplate/placements*
        - Optional
        - Type: opennebula_placements
    - *opennebula_vmtemplate/memorybacking*
        - Description: The optional memoryBacking element may contain several elements that influence how virtual memory pages are backed by host pages. hugepages: This tells the hypervisor that the guest should have its memory allocated using hugepages instead of the normal native page size. nosharepages: Instructs hypervisor to disable shared pages (memory merge, KSM) for this domain. locked: When set and supported by the hypervisor, memory pages belonging to the domain will be locked in hosts memory and the host will not be allowed to swap them out, which might be required for some workloads such as real-time. For QEMU/KVM guests, the memory used by the QEMU process itself will be locked too: unlike guest memory, this is an amount libvirt has no way of figuring out in advance, so it has to remove the limit on locked memory altogether. Thus, enabling this option opens up to a potential security risk: the host will be unable to reclaim the locked memory back from the guest when its running out of memory, which means a malicious guest allocating large amounts of locked memory could cause a denial-of-service attach on the host.
