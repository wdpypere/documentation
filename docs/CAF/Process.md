### NAME

CAF::Process - Class for running commands in CAF applications

### SYNOPSIS

    use CAF::Process;
    my $proc = CAF::Process->new ([qw (my command)], log => $self);
    $proc->pushargs (qw (more arguments));
    my $output = $proc->output();
    $proc->execute();

### DESCRIPTION

This class provides a convenient wrapper to LC::Process
functions. Commands are logged at the verbose level.

All these methods return the return value of their LC::Process
equivalent. This is different from the command's exit status, which is
stored in $?.

Please use these functions, and **do not** use ``` `` ```, `qx//` or
`system`. These functions won't spawn a subshell, and thus are more
secure.

#### Private methods

- `_initialize`

    Initialize the process object. Arguments:

    - `$command`

        A reference to an array with the command and its arguments.

    - `%opts`

        A hash with the command options:

        - `log`

            The log object. If not supplied, no logging will be performed.

        - `timeout`

            Maximum execution time, in seconds, for the command. If it's too slow
            it will be killed.

        - `pid`

            Reference to a scalar that will hold the child's PID.

        - `stdin`

            Data to be passed to the child's stdin

        - `stdout`

            Reference to a scalar that will have child's stdout

        - `stderr`

            Reference to a scalar that will hold the child's stderr.

        - `keeps_state`

            A boolean specifying whether the command respects the current system
            state or not. A command that `keeps_state` will be executed,
            regardless of any value for `NoAction`.

            By default, commands modify the state and thus `keeps_state` is
            false.

        - `sensitive`

            A boolean specifying whether the arguments contain sensitive information
            (like passwords). If `sensitive` is true, the commandline will not be reported
            (by default when `log` option is used, the commandline is reported
            with verbose level).

            This does not cover command output. If the output (stdout and/or stderr) contains
            sensitve information, make sure to handle it yourself via `stdout` and/or `stderr`
            options (or by using the `output` method).

        These options will only be used by the execute method.

- \_LC\_Process

    Run `LC::Process` `function` with arrayref arguments `args`.

    `noaction_value` is is the value to return with `NoAction`.

    `msg` and `postmsg` are used to construct log message
    `<<msg` command: <COMMAND>\[ &lt;postmsg>\]>>.

#### Public methods

- execute

    Runs the command, with the options passed at initialization time. If
    running on verbose mode, the exact command line and options are
    logged.

    Please, initialize the object with `log =` ''> if you are passing
    confidential data as an argument to your command.

- output

    Returns the output of the command. The output will not be logged for
    security reasons.

- toutput

    Returns the output of the command, that will be run with the timeout
    passed as an argument. The output will not be logged for security
    reasons.

- stream\_output

    Execute the commands using `execute`, but the `stderr` is
    redirected to `stdout`, and `stdout` is processed with `process`
    function. The total output is aggregated and returned when finished.

    Extra option is the process `mode`. By default (or value `undef`),
    the new output is passed to `process`. With mode `line`, `process`
    is called for each line of output (i.e. separated by newline), and
    the remainder of the output when the process is finished.

    Another option are the process `arguments`. This is a reference to the
    array of arguments passed to the `process` function.
    The arguments are passed before the output to the `process`: e.g.
    if `arguments =\` \[qw(a b)\]> is used, the `process` function is
    called like `process(a,b,$newoutput)` (with `$newoutput` the
    new streamed output)

    Example usage: during a `yum install`, you want to stop the yum process
    when an error message is detected.

        sub act {
            my ($self, $proc, $message) = @_;
            if ($message =~ m/error/) {
                $self->error("Error encountered, stopping process: $message");
                $proc->stop;
            }
        }

        $self->info("Going to start yum");
        my $p = CAF::Process->new([qw(yum install error)], input => 'init');
        $p->stream_output(\&act, mode => line, arguments => [$self, $p]);

- run

    Runs the command.

- trun

    Runs the command with $timeout seconds of timeout.

- pushargs

    Appends the arguments to the list of command arguments

- setopts

    Sets the hash of options passed to the options for the command

- stringify\_command

    Return the command and its arguments as a space separated string.

- get\_command

    Return the reference to the array with the command and its arguments.

- get\_executable

    Return the executable (i.e. the first element of the command).

- is\_executable

    Checks if the first element of the
    array with the command and its arguments, is executable.

    It returns the result of the `-x` test on the filename
    (or `undef` if filename can't be resolved).

    If the filename is equal to the `basename`, then the
    filename to test is resolved using the
    `File::Which::which` method.
    (Use `./script` if you want to check a script in the
    current working directory).

- execute\_if\_exists

    Execute after verifying the executable (i.e. the first
    element of the command) exists and is executable.

    If this is not the case the method returns 1.

### COMMON USE CASES

On the next examples, no log is used. If you want your component to
log the command, just add log => $self to the object creation.

#### Running a command

First, create the command:

    my $proc = CAF::Process->new (["ls", "-lh"]);

Then, choose amongst:

    $proc->run();
    $proc->execute();

#### Emulating backticks to get a command's output

Create the command:

    my $proc = CAF::Process->new (["ls", "-lh"]);

And get the output:

    my $output = $proc->output();

#### Piping into a command's stdin

Create the contents to be piped:

    my $contents = "Hello, world";

Create the command, specifying `$contents` as the input, and
`execute` it:

    my $proc = CAF::Process->new (["cat", "-"], stdin => $contents);
    $proc->execute();

#### Piping in and out

Suppose we want a bi-directional pipe: we provide the command's stdin,
and need to get its output and error:

    my ($stdin, $stdout, $stderr) = ("Hello, world", undef, undef);
    my $proc = CAF::Process->new (["cat", "-"], stdin => $stdin,
                                  stdout => \$stdout
                                  stderr => \$stderr);
    $proc->execute();

And we'll have the command's standard output and error on $stdout and
$stderr.

#### Creating the command dynamically

Suppose you want to add options to your command, dynamically:

    my $proc = CAF::Process->new (["ls", "-l"]);
    $proc->pushargs ("-a", "-h");
    if ($my_expression) {
        $proc->pushargs ("-S");
    }

    # Runs ls -l -a -h -S
    $proc->run();

#### Subshells

Okay, you **really** want them. You can't live without them. You found
some obscure case that really needs a shell. Here is how to get
it. But please, don't use it without a **good** reason:

    my $cmd = CAF::Process->new(["ls -lh|wc -l"], log => $self,
                                 shell => 1);
    $cmd->execute();

It will only work with the `execute` method.
