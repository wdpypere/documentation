### NAME

CAF::Exception - provides basic methods for failure and exception handling

#### Private methods

- \_get\_noaction

    Return NoAction setting:

    - Return 0 is `keeps_state` is true

        Any other value of `keeps_state` is ignored. (In particular,
        you cannot use `keeps_state` to enable NoAction).

    - Return value of `noAction` method (when defined)
    - `CAF::Object::NoAction` otherwise

    Supports an optional `msg` that is prefixed to reporter.

- \_reset\_exception\_fail

    Reset previous fail attribute and/or exception.

    `msg` is a suffix when reporting the old `fail` attribute
    and/or exception error (with debug level 1).

    `EC` is a `LC::Exception::Context` instance that is checked for an
    existing error, which is set to ignore if it exists.

    Always returns SUCCESS.

- \_function\_catch

    Execute function reference `funcref` with arrayref `$args` and hashref `$opts`.

    Method resets any existing fail attribute and error from `LC::Exception::Context` instance `EC`.

    When an exception thrown is thrown, it is catched and reset. No error is reported
    and undef is returned in this case and the fail attribute is set with the exception
    error text.

- \_safe\_eval

    Run function reference `funcref` with arrayref `argsref` and hashref `optsref`.

    Return and set fail attribute with `failmsg` (`$@` is added when set) on die
    or in case of an error (`undef` returned by `funcref`).
    In case of success, report `msg` (stringified result is added unless `sensitive` attribute is set)
    at verbose level.

    Note that `_safe_eval` doesn't work with functions
    that don't return a defined value when they succeed.

    Resets previous fail attribute and or exceptions
    (via the `LC::Exception::Context` instance `EC`).
